`Very soon, it will be Tanabata.`
`A familiar event, marked by the hanging of pieces of paper, with wishes written on them, on bamboo branches.`
`It is not often that such wishes are granted,`
` but sometimes, spirits and souls of the dead, or even demons and witches, will find the wishes by chance and grant them...`
`Ushiromiya Maria was supposed to write such a wish at school.`
`There was plenty of paper, so students were allowed to use several pieces, if they could think of enough wishes.`
`At first, everyone was excited about writing a lot of them,`
` but, despite their youth, after writing two or three wishes,`
` they have come to realise to their own surprise that they could only write trivial things, such as {qt}I want to be rich{qt} or {qt}I want to become such and such{qt}.`
`However, unlike the other children, Maria thought that writing one wish was enough.`
`{a:c:`
`{qt}I wish that my Mama would come home every day{qt}}`
`Rosa was busy with work, and had to spend the night there often.`
`Just like a child should, Maria understood that it was just part of her mother's job,`
` but that didn't mean she didn't feel lonely.`
`So she wrote down her simple wish about her mother coming home every day.`
`By the way,`
` have you ever thought about who grants the wishes written on these pieces of paper..?`
`There are several theories:`
` the Tanabata legend and the various ancient Japanese gods,`
` but all of those are, in fact, false.`
`What grants the wish is that which is closest to the person who wrote it.`
`It can be the so-called guardian spirits or ancestors of the person.`
` For those without a guardian spirit, it might be their parents or a close friend.`
`And to Maria, that witch was even closer than her mother.`
`So, in Maria's dreams on the night of the Tanabata,`
` Beato accepted the wish that the girl had entrusted to that piece of paper, and read it...`
`{qt}...Maria... Maria.`
` Can you hear me?{qt}`
`{qt}...Eh?`
` ...Oh, it's {f:5:Beatrice}..!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} came to Maria in a dream..!{qt}`
`{qt}Indeed.`
` Today, you hung a Tanabata wish on some bamboo, did you not?`
` That wish has reached me,`
` ...and I have come to grant it.{qt}`
`{qt}Really?!`
` Thanks, {f:5:Beatrice}!`
` Uu!{qt}`
`{qt}Now, let us discuss your wish.`
` You have wished for {qt}your mother to come home every day{qt}.`
` But, are you quite sure?{qt}`
`{qt}Yes.`
` Just that alone will make me happy.{qt}`
`{qt}Hrm...{qt}`
`Beato crossed her arms and mumbled to herself.`
`It seemed as if she was considering turning Maria down, and was thinking of how to best explain herself.`
`When Maria saw Beato, whom she considered all-powerful, make such a face,`
` she grew anxious...`
`{qt}...Uu.`
` Is having Mama come back home a difficult wish to grant?{qt}`
`{qt}No.`
` Quite honestly,`
` it's a piece of cake.`
` But Maria,`
` consider it carefully.`
` Is her merely coming home actually enough?{qt}`
`{qt}.........?{qt}`
`{qt}Should your wish be granted,`
` then from tomorrow on, your mother will return home every single day.`
` However, she may not always be in a good mood, understand?{qt}`
`Rosa was the CEO of a small business.`
` So far, things have been going badly, and she was in a precarious financial situation every day.`
`She was desperately trying to expand her business by clinging on to any order she could get,`
` and using that to bring in more requests little by little.`
`If Rosa would always come home in such a state,`
` it wouldn't end well.`
`In order for Rosa's company to achieve financial security overnight,`
` she'd have to make the wish herself and make it clear exactly what the magic should be used to change.`
`So, even if the magic from Maria's wish could reach Rosa, it would not extend to Rosa's company.`
`In short, if Maria's wish was to be granted with the way she phrased it,`
` Rosa would either lose her job, or her entire company would collapse.`
`That likely wasn't something Maria actually wanted.`
` Hence, Beato visited Maria in her dream to inquire about her true desires.`
`{qt}So, Maria,`
` make your true wish heard.`
` Your mother merely coming home is not quite enough for you, is it?{qt}`
`{qt}.....No.`
` Just having Mama come home every day is...`
` not enough.{qt}`
`{qt}Indeed.`
` Your real wish comes after.{qt}`
`The wish of her mother coming home was only the beginning.`
`Her true desires weren't quite so abstract.`
`Normally, if the ones granting the wish were mischievous, they would grant it no matter how abstract it was.`
`But Beato was Maria's close friend, and would never play such a trick on her.`
`Because she knew that Maria's true wish wasn't quite so simple.`
`{qt}Your mother shall return home. And so I ask: what next..?{qt}`
`{qt}Mama will always come home early... and make dinner with Maria.{qt}`
`{qt}What next..?{qt}`
`{qt}We'll have fun talking together, peeling potatoes and setting up dishes.{qt}`
`{qt}Then..?{qt}`
`{qt}Then, we'll watch TV together,`
` laughing at some funny show and enjoying our delicious meal.`
` That will be so much fun.`
` I'm sure that will make me happy.{qt}`
`She didn't just want her mother to come home every day.`
`The happiness painted in Maria's mind continued far beyond that...`
`It was a wonderful time just to imagine.`
`Two people cooking a meal and enjoying it together while having some small talk.`
`Maria had never once asked Rosa to eat out...`
` Just eating at the table with her mother was more than enough.`
`It made her happy whenever it happened, but it was a very rare occurrence.`
` Maria simply wanted to have that every day.`
`The glimpse of that dream world made Beato smile warmly.`
`Maria was impatient to have her wish be granted,`
` but Beato merely giggled and spoke yet again.`
`{qt}Are you sure this is all you want?{qt}`
`{qt}Eh..?{qt}`
`{qt}I'd imagine your dream extends beyond a mere dinner.`
` ...So for me to consider granting your wish, I need to hear more of it.`
` You two will enjoy a nice dinner together. What next?{qt}`
`{qt}..................{qt}`
`It was only natural.`
` ...Fun meals between mother and daughter were but a part of a healthy family lifestyle.`
`I'll make tea for Mama.`
`As we drink our delicious tea together, we'll watch TV.`
`Then I'll heat up the bath, and we'll bathe together.`
`I'll even put in one of those bubble-filled bath bombs that Mama loves.`
` Then we'll splash around having fun in the tub, and make even more bubbles.`
`Then she'll kiss me goodnight, get things ready for tomorrow, and go to sleep.`
`...Then, the sun will rise, I'll wake up early, and wake Mama up if she oversleeps.`
`Good morning, Sakutaro.`
` Yes, I know.`
` I'll bring Mama something to drink.`
`I'll bring her some original blend vegetable juice in a chilled cup.`
`If she drinks it right after waking up, she'll feel refreshed and smile.`
`I'll put bread in the toaster and cover it with rose-flavored jam.`
`Then I'll wait for the morning paper and set it on Mama's chair.`
`Alright, I'll be back soon, Sakutaro.`
`After a morning like this, I'll be happy all day long at school.`
`School is fun too, and everyone in the rabbit band is always happy as well.`
` They make a real ruckus in my pocket.`
`I'm sure Mama will be successful at work.`
`I'm sure that she'll come back home in a good mood.`
`I'm sure that we will always, always be happy, every day.`
`{qt}........................{qt}`
`I could hear a monotonous, buzzing electronic noise.`
`It was coming from my alarm clock.`
`...Ah.`
` ...I must have been dreaming.`
`{qt}I wish that Mama will come home every day{qt}.`
` A small piece of bamboo with that piece of paper hanging from it was beside my pillow.`
`I wonder if that's why I had such a strange dream.`
`...{f:5:Beatrice} came from Rokkenjima... and clearly showed me a world that I couldn't even see when I was writing that wish of mine down.`
` ...A world in which my Mama would simply come home every day has expanded more and more, into infinity.`
`No, that's not all. Until a second ago, I really was in that world.`
`I'm sure that, just for the smallest of moments, {f:5:Beatrice} granted my wish for me using her magic...`
`She has endlessly expanded my unambitious wish.`
`After all, {f:5:Beatrice} is the Endless witch.`
`...And if the world she has shown me was made by magic, ...as a witch apprentice, I should be able to create it myself.`
`That happy dream, which was so faint that the alarm had drawn me away from it... I should be able to make into something real.`
`As a witch apprentice, Maria knew how to make that magic a reality.`
`{a:c:`
`{qt}...Uu.`
`...By believing.{qt}}`
`Yes.`
` Belief is what grants magic its power.`
`And thus, Maria strongly believed that it wasn't a dream, but something that actually came true.`
`...What's the first thing I should do on this happy morning?`
`That's right.`
` First, I'll wake Mama up.`
`I'll bring her a cup of chilled vegetable juice.`
`Maria jumped out of bed and headed for the kitchen.`
`She wanted to let her mother know that this was the start of a happy morning, which would lead to happy days today and tomorrow.`
`{qt}Thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Thank you for making my Tanabata wish come true.`
`{a:c:`
`--The End.}`
`{qt}...The heck was that?`
` It seems like Beato never actually granted her wish.{qt}`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} shrugged mockingly.`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta}, who had been chuckling at how sweet the story had been, looked annoyed at this wet blanket response.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} noticed Bern's lack of understanding.`
`{qt}That's untrue.`
` I've woven a fragment of the world of Maria's desires, and given her a key to unlock it.`
` The only thing Maria has to do now is to unlock the door.{qt}`
`{qt}Even if you made her happy,`
` ...she made her wish come true herself. You did nothing.{qt}`
`{qt}Bern, you're acting like a spoiled child.`
` There's no way for a wish to be granted unless there is a strong desire for it to come true.{qt}`
`{qt}...Humans with a will that strong will eventually grant that wish themselves, regardless of whether a witch grants it or not.`
` There's no point in witches getting involved at all.{qt}`
`{qt}You see, I wouldn't want to grant someone's wish if they weren't certain about it.{qt}`
`{qt}Exactly.`
` Certainty in willpower creates an absolutely certain future.`
` Our infatuation with the strength of that will leads us to just unconsciously lend them our power, right?{qt}`
`{qt}Yes, precisely.`
` It wouldn't be interesting if the wish weren't bold enough to make us unconsciously want to lend our power.{qt}`
`{qt}Bern, you take people's efforts and the strength of their wishes a little too lightly.{qt}`
`Beato and Lambda kept complaining about Bern's utter lack of comprehension.`
`{qt}...Oh?`
` Then, Lambda, how would you grant a wish?`
` Have you also granted someone's wish on this Tanabata..?{qt}`
`{qt}Hoh...`
` What say you, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}?`
` I believe that one so beloved by humans should be an expert in granting wishes.{qt}`
`{qt}Me?`
` I keep it simple.`
` I just encourage everyone to give it their all, fairly and equally.{qt}`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} is the Witch of Certainty.`
` She praises the willpower to certainly succeed until the very end.`
`Despite possessing both innocence and cruelty, she also has a more tender side with regards to people's passion.`
`{qt}The most common wishes I get are {qt}I want to be super-rich{qt},`
` or {qt}I want a promotion{qt},`
` or {qt}I want to solidify my current position{qt},`
` things like that.{qt}`
`{qt}Just now, you said that you fairly and equally encourage everyone, but do you really grant such impudent wishes for everyone..?{qt}`
`{qt}Of course not.`
` I avoid granting those wishes to everyone in equal measure.`
` But in exchange, I watch over the ones who don't slack off in their efforts until their wish is realized, also in equal measure.{qt}`
`Lambda will never smile upon humans who wish to 'become super-rich', but do nothing to work towards that goal.`
`Also, she will never grant success to those who only try to become super-rich once.`
`What {f:5:Lambdadelta} bestows is not the fulfillment of the wish, ...but the power needed to achieve it.`
`{qt}Anyone could actually grant the wish of {qt}I want to be super-rich{qt}, you know?`
` Obviously, it would take some effort.`
` What I guarantee is that the effort will not go to waste.{qt}`
`{qt}...However, you make no guarantees about the necessary amount of effort, huh?{qt}`
`{qt}*cackle*cackle*.`
` I see.`
` Effort will eventually bring fruit, but you can't promise when.`
` You are quite cruel.{qt}`
`{qt}Really?`
` You don't think the guarantee that your efforts will bring fruit is worth much?`
` ...You see, I like hard-working people.`
` I like people who throw away everything for their goal, and who are capable of abandoning themselves to unending self-torment to achieve it.{qt}`
`Those who make their wishes to {f:5:Lambdadelta} must strongly believe that those wishes will be granted eventually.`
`Without the strength of heart, the wishes would never reach {f:5:Lambdadelta}, and would never be granted the help of the magic of Certainty.`
`And, to those people who certainly never give up, and do not forget the meaning of hard work,`
` it's blasphemous to all their hard work to have their wishes simply be granted by another person.`
`That's why {f:5:Lambdadelta} would never dirty their precious hard work.`
`All she promises is that certain determination will lead to a certain success.`
`And, just that is enough.`
`Your wish will certainly be granted.`
` No matter what it is.`
` Some day.`
`Even if you are just a child who wishes to become a god...`
`{qt}Hmm.`
` So that is the Magic of Certainty.`
` A magnificent power that is in no way inferior to my own Endless Magic.{qt}`
`{qt}Yeah right, it's way better...!`
` You're rock.`
` I'm paper!`
` Double-twisted, super-thick super-paper!{qt}`
`{qt}...That just means you're a wound-up idiot.`
` Well, I suppose that fits.{qt}`
`{qt}Right!?`
` Ohohohoho!{qt}`
`With Lambda being the only one who didn't get it, the three witches cackled together...`
`{qt}Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, are you not the witch who controls miracles?`
` There must me as many humans who want you to grant a wish as there are stars in the sky.{qt}`
`{qt}Yeah, miracles.`
` Those are not something that should ever be granted.`
` Though I imagine the overly ambitious yet lazy people would love that.`
` But that's no good at all!`
` Those filthy wishes are unfitting for someone as wonderful as you, Bern.`
` Before you look at wishes of people like that, grant my wish first, Be~rn!{qt}`
`{qt}...Let go of me, you're too warm.`
` Miracles are called miracles because they don't happen.`
` To me, granting a wish is in itself a miracle.{qt}`
`{qt}Human passions don't generally amount to much to us witches...`
` But it seems they don't amount to anything at all to you.{qt}`
`{qt}...I don't want to hear that from someone who made a name for herself through endless cruelty.{qt}`
`{qt}*cackle*cackle*cackle*, wahhahahahahahahaha!`
` Not much I can say against that.`
` I may have been too uncharacteristically soft today.{qt}`
`{qt}Well, you are really easy-going when it comes to Maria, Beato.`
` You should spread that around to more people besides Maria.`
` You're like sugar leftovers.{qt}`
`{qt}...Exactly.`
` It's not just Beato, either.`
` You too have been easy-going today, Lambda.`
` Both of you are a little too sweet for my liking today.`
` ...Dried plums go better with tea than sugar.{qt}`
`{qt}Bern,`
` it's not like Tanabata comes every day, right?`
` Go and grant at least one wish.{qt}`
`{qt}Nope.{qt}`
`With a fed up look on her face, Bern disappeared.`
`She had lost her humanity over a thousand years.`
` She no longer enjoyed sweet and heartwarming stories.`
`Beato laughed coldly, as though this was the way a witch was supposed to be.`
`In her expression, no longer was there any of the warmth that had woven Maria's happiness...`
`You're telling me to grant at least one wish because it's Tanabata?`
