`Very soon, it will be Tanabata.`
`A familiar event, marked by the hanging of pieces of paper, with wishes written on them, on bamboo branches.`
`It is not often that such wishes are granted,`
` but sometimes, spirits and souls of the dead, or even demons and witches, will find the wishes by chance and grant them...`
`Ushiromiya Maria was supposed to write such a wish at school.`
`There was plenty of paper, so students were allowed to use several pieces, if they could think of enough wishes.`
`At first, everyone was excited about writing a lot of them,`
` but, despite their youth, after writing two or three wishes,`
` they have come to realise to their own surprise that they could only write trivial things, such as {qt}I want to be rich{qt} or {qt}I want to become such and such{qt}.`
`However, unlike the other children, Maria thought that writing one wish was enough.`
`{a:c:`
`{qt}I wish that my Mama would come home every day{qt}}`
`Rosa was busy with work, and had to spend the night there often.`
`Just like a child should, Maria understood that it was just part of her mother's job,`
` but that didn't mean she didn't feel lonely.`
`So she wrote down her simple wish about her mother coming home every day.`
`By the way,`
` have you ever thought about who grants the wishes written on these pieces of paper..?`
`There are several theories:`
` the Tanabata legend and the various ancient Japanese gods,`
` but all of those are, in fact, false.`
`What grants the wish is that which is closest to the person who wrote it.`
`It can be the so-called guardian spirits or ancestors of the person.`
` For those without a guardian spirit, it might be their parents or a close friend.`
`And to Maria, that witch was even closer than her mother.`
`So, in Maria's dreams on the night of the Tanabata,`
` Beato accepted the wish that the girl had entrusted to that piece of paper, and read it...`
`{qt}...Maria... Maria.`
` Can you hear me?{qt}`
`{qt}...Eh?`
` ...Oh, it's {f:5:Beatrice}..!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} came to Maria in a dream..!{qt}`
`{qt}Indeed.`
` Today, you hung a Tanabata wish on some bamboo, did you not?`
` That wish has reached me,`
` ...and I have come to grant it.{qt}`
`{qt}Really?!`
` Thanks, {f:5:Beatrice}!`
` Uu!{qt}`
`{qt}Now, let us discuss your wish.`
` You have wished for {qt}your mother to come home every day{qt}.`
` But, are you quite sure?{qt}`
`{qt}Yes.`
` Just that alone will make me happy.{qt}`
`{qt}Hrm...{qt}`
`Beato crossed her arms and mumbled to herself.`
`It seemed as if she was considering turning Maria down, and was thinking of how to best explain herself.`
`When Maria saw Beato, whom she considered all-powerful, make such a face,`
` she grew anxious...`
`{qt}...Uu.`
` Is having Mama come back home a difficult wish to grant?{qt}`
`{qt}No.`
` Quite honestly,`
` it's a piece of cake.`
` But Maria,`
` consider it carefully.`
` Is her merely coming home actually enough?{qt}`
