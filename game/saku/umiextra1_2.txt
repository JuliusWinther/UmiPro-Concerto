d `Very soon, it will be Tanabata.`[\]
*e2_2
d `A familiar event, marked by the hanging of pieces of paper, with wishes written on them, on bamboo branches.`[\]
*e2_3
d `It is not often that such wishes are granted,`[@]` but sometimes, spirits and souls of the dead, or even demons and witches, will find the wishes by chance and grant them...`[\]

*e2_4
d `Ushiromiya Maria was supposed to write such a wish at school.`[\]
*e2_5
d `There was plenty of paper, so students were allowed to use several pieces, if they could think of enough wishes.`[\]
*e2_6
d `At first, everyone was excited about writing a lot of them,`[@] ` but, despite their youth, after writing two or three wishes,`[@]` they have come to realise to their own surprise that they could only write trivial things, such as {qt}I want to be rich{qt} or {qt}I want to become such and such{qt}.`[\]
*e2_7

*e2_12
d `By the way,`[@]` have you ever thought about who grants the wishes written on these pieces of paper..?`[\]
*e2_13
d `There are several theories:`[@]` the Tanabata legend and the various ancient Japanese gods,`[@] `but all of those are, in fact, false.`[\]
*e2_14
d `What grants the wish is that which is closest to the person who wrote it.`[\]
*e2_15
d `It can be the so-called guardian spirits or ancestors of the person.`[@]` For those without a guardian spirit, it might be their parents or a close friend.`[\]

*e2_17
d `So, in Maria's dreams on the night of the Tanabata,`[@]` Beato accepted the wish that the girl had entrusted to that piece of paper, and read it...`[\]
